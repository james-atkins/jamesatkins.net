I am a student at Bocconi University, Milan, where I am studying for a master's degree in Economic and Social Sciences. I gained my bachelor's degree, also in economics, from the University of Cambridge.

Before coming to Bocconi, I worked as a consultant at [DotEcon](http://www.dotecon.com/), a London based economic consultancy firm with a particular focus on *network industries* such as telecommunications, transport and payment systems. Projects I worked on included a cost-benefit analysis of the BBC's research and development activity, the implementation of winner determination software for a spectrum auction in the Republic of Ireland, and support to bidders in spectrum and media rights auctions in Saudi Arabia and India.
